# odin-recipes
I'm going to create an index.html file, fil it with the boilerplate HTML and add an h1 heading "Odin Recipes
I'm going to create another HTML file and name it after the recipe it'll contain.
I'm going to add a link to the recipe on index.html
I'll add an image of the finished dish under the h1 heading and then I'll describe the recipe
afterwards i'll add more recipes
