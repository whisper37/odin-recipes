<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Sirloin steak comes from the rear back portion of the cow, and comes in two parts; the top sirloin and the bottom sirloin. The top sirloin is the more tender cut, and is typically labeled as “top sirloin” on the packaging. Bottom sirloin is less tender, and is typically just referred to as “sirloin” or “sirloin steak”. Both types of sirloin are quite tender and flavorful, and benefit from a short cooking time.</p>
