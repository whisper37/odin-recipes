<h1>Sirloin Steak with Garlic Butter</h1>
<img src="./steak.jpg">

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Sirloin steak comes from the rear back portion of the cow, and comes in two parts; the top sirloin and the bottom sirloin. The top sirloin is the more tender cut, and is typically labeled as “top sirloin” on the packaging. Bottom sirloin is less tender, and is typically just referred to as “sirloin” or “sirloin steak”. Both types of sirloin are quite tender and flavorful, and benefit from a short cooking time.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 1/4 pounds sirloin steak I like top sirloin</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
<li>4 tablespoons butter softened</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon garlic minced</li>
<li>1 tablespoon minced fresh herbs such as thyme, parsley or chives, plus more for garnish</li>

</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Pat each steak dry with a paper towel. Heat a large cast iron skillet or other heavy pan over medium high heat.</li>
    <li>Pour the olive oil into the pan. Season the steaks on both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Place the steaks in a single layer in the pan. Cook for 4-5 minutes per side or until browned. Use a thermometer to cook the steak to your desired level of doneness. I recommend cooking to medium which is 145 degrees F.</li>
    <li>While the steak is cooking, place the butter in a bowl along with the garlic, herbs, salt and pepper. Stir to combine.</li>
    <li>Let the steaks rest for at least 5 minutes off the heat. Place a dollop of butter on top of each steak. Slice the steak. Garnish with additional fresh herbs if desired, then serve.</li>
